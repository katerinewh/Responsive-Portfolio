              <p>Hello! My name is Katerine Whattoff-Hall and I am a full-stack web developer. </p>

              <p>I’ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. Although my
                professional path has taken many twists and turns — from radio and television broadcasting, to
                fundraising for non-profit organizations, to higher education executive leadership — I've never stopped
                engaging my passion to help others and solve problems.

                As a web developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making
                things, and my mission-driven work ethic to literally change the world. That's why I’m excited to make
                a big impact creating software for clients ranging from individuals and small businesses all the way to
                large enterprise corporations...I want to make things that make a difference.</p>

              <p>Feel free to take a look at my most recent projects on my portfolio page, or use the icons below to
                check out my Github and LinkedIn profiles. Say hello by clicking on the "contact me" link at the top of
                the page...I'd love to hear from you!</p>
